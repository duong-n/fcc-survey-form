# Project: [FreeCodeCamp][fcc] - Tribute Page

This is part of **[Responsive Web Design Certification][rwd]** on [FreeCodeCamp][fcc]

The project I completed is the minimum to pass the tests so that I can move on without having to spend many hours and days on this project. I **will** come back to this project in the future to make it look better than what it _currently_ looks like. I plan on incorporating JavaScript into the project when I complete that section.

**Thank you for reading, greatly _appreciated_!!**
